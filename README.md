üëãüèΩ  My name is Partha (Par-tha), and I am a student who is passionate about software engineering and loves a challenge.  
<br />

üéì  I am pursuing an Ontario Secondary School Diploma at SATEC @ W.A. Porter Collegiate Institute.
<br />


üíª At the moment, I have experimented with many different programming languages but I have working knowledge and experience mostly with python and C++. I have taken the computer science and computer engineering classes at my school and I am apart of the CETA Robotics club. I also have done other online coding courses but I'm looking to gain more applied experience. I previously worked as a camp counsellor during the summer and so I'm quite comfortable collaborating with pretty much anybody, whether they're 5 years old or 50. My goal for the future is to study computer science or software engineering at university. 

<br />
